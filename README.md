# SIMON-SAYS-GAME
SIMON SAYS is a classic memory game where players must replicate a sequence of colors by the computer. With each successful round, the sequence gets longer, challenging the player's memory and attention. This project brings the nostalgic game to the digital age with modern coding practices and user interface design.
